# Cipher-spry

Cipher-spry is a pattern recognition and word puzzle game built with React.  
Players are presented with a "transformed" word and must deduce the original word by recognizing the underlying pattern or cipher. The game features multiple difficulty levels, a timer, scoring, hints, and a colorful interactive UI.

## Features

- Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Timer and scoring system
- Real-time feedback on guesses
- Hints for each puzzle
- Reveal answer and alphabet reference tools
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## How to Play

1. Select a difficulty level to start a new game.
2. A transformed word will appear. Type your guess for the original word.
3. Submit your answer before the timer runs out.
4. Use hints if you get stuck, or reveal the answer (with a score penalty).
5. Try to get the highest score possible!
